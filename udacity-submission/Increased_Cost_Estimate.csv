,"I made a few change of:"
," - Increase lambda call request"
," - Change EC2 Instance type"
," - Increase NAT Transfer data limit"
," - Increase RDS instance type"
," - Increase number of the API Gateway access per hours"
," - Increase RAM of Lambda function => more RAM, more CPU"
," - Increase DynamoDB write capacity"
," => We increase all component to serve higher accessible need, especial the EC2 Instance, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB which are the main component of the system, beside we have to level up the network and transfering data to meet with other service, Increase CloudFront and S3 will help better user UI experience."
