,"I made a few change of "
," - lambda call request (make it from 20 down to 10 request per second), "
," - EC2 storage (reduce it from 80GB to 50GB), "
," - Reduce NAT Transfer data limit"
," - Reduce the backup plan and number backup of storage of RDS but not instance type"
," - Reduce the number of queries and number of healcheck, not impact much on access"
," - Also reduce a few number of people sign in through SAML or OIDC federation from 50 to 40"
," - Reduce number of the API Gateway access per hours"
," - Reduce Lambda Number of Request per second to reduce cost"
," => With lower cost we have to reduce the overall all the resource, data transfer, accessible, storage,... of all components in the system, but we can not reduce 1 or 2 component down to least, that can cause bottleneck."
